Stellarium is a mod that include a whole new class to the game : The Magus Class
With new weapons, tools that you can use to do a lot of things, new ores.
Nearly every item in this mod can be crafted with various materials added by the mods.
You can loot the three essences on all ennemies.
WoF can loot the Magus Emblem.
Every boss past hardmode (even pre-hardmode ones) loots 2 Magus Core Shards.

This mod aims to adapt the entire X'e Plora universe (Made by me : "https://xeplora.fandom.com/fr/wiki/") into Terraria.
For the moment, it's mostly a WIP, but a lot of things will come overtime.
Things that will come in the near future :
- Special powers
- Other classes
- A whole new underground biome
- A crazy lot of new items/materials/weapons/tools

Next TODO :
- Other classes
(Holes : EXP system, can unlock abilities (teleportation, destruction, elemental power))
